In this dungeon-themed top-down shooter game, the player is tasked with making their way through the dungeon ruins with a pistol to fight through enemies and collect the Arctium crystals at the end of each level. The player starts the game with 100 health and an inventory of 6 slots. If the player loses all their health, they die and restart at the beginning of the current level with their inventory retained.
